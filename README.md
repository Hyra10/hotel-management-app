# Hotel Management App

This project was created when I was in the University
the idea to build this app came up after knowing that teachers used just paper and pen to mimc a real hotel management app
so I decided to create a MVP that mimics what a real hotel managament app does
but just for a turism teacher to teach their students a simulation of a real hotel management app
where you can create hotels, rooms, activity rooms, clients, staff.
you can also book a room or an activity room.

it uses ReactJS, React-apollo, Graphql, Typescript, JSS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
